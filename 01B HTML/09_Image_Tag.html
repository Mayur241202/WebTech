    <h1>Image Tag</h1>

    <p>Used to add image to our page. It is not a pair tag like <b>heading tag</b>, <b>paragraph tag</b>, etc.</p>

    <img src="09A_Doraemon.jpg" alt="Doraemon" height="500px" width="600px">

    <p>Here we have not to add any input text like we did in <b>anchor tag</b> or any other pair tag.</p>

    <p><b>Image tag</b> consist of some attributes like <b>src</b> which is used to include <b>relative URL</b>(We have to save image in same folder in which our html file saved.) or <b>absolute URL</b>(We have to add url of the image which avilable on internet but <b>if that image was deleted from internet then our image is also not shown in our website.</b>)</p>

    <p>Second main attribute of image tag is <b>alt</b>(alternate title) which is used for alternate name if image is not shown on the page due to some issue.</p>

    <p>Also we have some attributes to adjust the image size to fit in page like <b>height</b> and <b>width</b>.</p>
