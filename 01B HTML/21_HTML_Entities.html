                <li>An HTML entity is an piece ot text or string that begins with an ampersand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;).</li>

                <li>Used to display reserved characters(which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters(like non-breaking spaces).</li>

                <li>Can also use in place of charactes that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.</li>

                <li>Browser interprets them and renders correct charecter.</li>

        <h2>Space</h2>

        <p>
            space is created by using nbsp i.e. non breaking space.

            <h3>Example</h3>

            <p>Without space in p tag</p>

            <p>With &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space in p tag.</p>
        </p>

        <h2>Less Than</h2>

        <p>Less than is created by lt.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p>a &lt; b</p>

        <p><b>Note :</b> Similary for greater than we use <b>gt</b>, for ampersand we use <b>amp</b> and for quotes we use <b>quot</b> on both side ot text.</p>

        <p><b>Note : </b>Similarly for characters or symbols that are not directly typed through keyboard like heart, star, sun, etc have some codes or names to display them on screen.</p>
