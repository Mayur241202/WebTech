    <h1>Practice - Specificity</h1>

    <p><b>Q. 1 : </b>For the given HTML and CSS code what is color of h1 ?</p>
    <p><img src="15A_img_1.png" alt="Que_1" width="300px"></p>

    <p><b>ans. :</b> For this we have to calculate specificity.</p>

    <p><b>h1</b> has specificity (0, 0, 1) as h1 is an element. <b>#greet</b> has specificity (1, 0, 0) as greet is an Id. <b>.myClass</b> has specificity (0, 1, 0) as myClass is a class. Therefore h1 has <b>yellow</b> color.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Q. 2 :</b> For the given HTML and CSS code what is background-color of p ?</p>

    <p><img src="15A_img_2.png" alt="Que_2" width="300px"></p>

    <p><b>ans. :</b></p>

    <p><b>div p</b> has specificity (0, 0, 2) as div and p are 2 elements. <b>.para</b> has specificity (0, 1, 0) as para is a class. <b>p</b> has specificity (0, 0, 1) as p is an element. Therefore p has background-color <b>blue</b>.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><b>Q. 3 :</b> For the given HTML and CSS code what is color of text "Hello world!" ?</p>

    <p><img src="15A_img_3.png" alt="Que_3" width="300px"></p>

    <p><b>ans. :</b></p>

    <p><b>div.greetDiv .greet</b> has specificity (0, 2, 1) as div is an element, greetDiv and greet are two classes. <b>.greetDiv p.greet</b> has specificity (0, 2, 1) as p is an element, greetDiv and greet are two classes. <b>.greetDiv .greet</b> has specificity (0, 2, 0) as greetDiv and greet are two classes.</p>

    <p>Here specificity of <b>div.greetDiv .greet</b> and <b>.greetDiv p.greet</b> are same and hence here we apply cascading. Therefore final answer is depend on <b>.greetDiv p.greet</b> as this will come after <b>div.greetDiv .greet</b>. Therefore "Hello World!" is in <b>blue</b> color.</p>
