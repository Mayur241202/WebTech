    <h1>Cascading</h1>

    <p>The CSS cascade algorithm job is to select CSS declarations in order to deetermine the correct value. In cascading the style which is applied is the last one which is written for same element as first one. For example, if we give a color green to a paragraph and after that we again write a code for same paragraph and this time give a color blue then blue color is implemented.</p>

    <h1>Example</h1>

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Natus at voluptas, commodi numquam, minima deleniti adipisci quo unde debitis in dignissimos beatae excepturi, consequatur quaerat molestias eius voluptatum ratione expedita.</p>

    <p>Here first we give a green color to paragraph and then written the same code again to give a color blue to same paragraph and hence blue color is applied.</p>

    <p>Note : This is applied for multiple CSS documents also. Whichever CSS file is declared later in HTML document that style will applied to that elements which are declared in that file.</p>
