        <h1>Why Not Internal CSS?</h1>

        <p>If our website is big enough so that we want number of HTML pages then to style them again we have to write internal CSS for each HTML page. To avoid this we mostly prefer External CSS.</p>

        <h1>External CSS</h1>

        <p>Writing CSS in a seperate document and link it with HTML file.</p>

        <p>After creating seperate CSS file we have to link it with HTML file by using <b>link</b> tag which is defined in head tag. This will demostrate in next html file.</p>

        <p>link tag includes two main attributes <b>rel</b>(relation) and <b>href</b>(reference link) of CSS file.</p>
